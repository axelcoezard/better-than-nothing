# Better than Nothing
Everything is in the title, it is a better-than-nothing Game Engine

## Features

 - Support for Linux.
 - Support for Vulkan.
 - In-house JIT shader compilation.

## Road map

I've created a Trello board to provide some insight on what I have planned for the future of the game engine.
On this board, you'll find upcoming features, target time frames, and any emergent known issues.
Please note that at this time, the current Trello is in English only.

You can find the board [here](https://trello.com/b/pKXNk3bb/road-map).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Both new features and bug fixes. Just open a pull request.
